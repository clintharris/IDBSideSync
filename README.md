# Overview

IDBSideSync is a JavaScript library that makes it possible to sync IndexedDB object stores using CRDT concepts. It works by intercepting the CRUD calls to IndexedDB objects and automatically logging all the operations "on the side" in a separate store--the operation log. The objects in the operation log can be uploaded somewhere, then downloaded and "replayed" somewhere else, in effect, synchronizing IndexedDB stores across devices without conflict.

You can use this library to, for example, build a "[local first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html)" [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/) that also supports syncing across differenct devices without having to run a custom backend server. Once a user enables a remote storage service of their choosing via OAuth (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud), the application can use that to backup/sync data. The user owns their own data and decides where to store it, and the application developer never sees that data.

The idea for the library came from studying [James Long](https://twitter.com/jlongster)'s
[crdt-example-app](https://github.com/jlongster/crdt-example-app), which offers a fantastic demonstration of how to use [CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type), [hybrid logical clock](https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/hybrid-logical-clocks/), and merkle tree concepts to build a simple, ephemeral/in-memory data store (that relies on a custom server for synchronization across instances of the application). `IDBSideSync` is an attempt at applying those concepts (and in some cases, modified versions of James' code) to work with [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), specifically. It also adds the ability for HTTP-accessible data storage APIs that users already have (or host themselves) as the means for syncing data instead of relying on a single, developer-owned, server application. `IDBSideSync` was deliberately forked from `crdt-example-app` to make that "heritage" literally part of this project's own history.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

IDBSideSync is still experimental and under development. Some parts of it have not been tested, some things are incomplete, etc. It is not ready for production.

# Usage

```
npm install --save @clintharris/IDBSideSync
```

First, you'll need to add a few lines to your existing IndexedDB setup code for initializing `IDBSideSync`:

```javascript
const openreq = indexedDB.open('todo-app', 1);

openreq.onupgradeneeded = (event) => {
  const db = event.target.result;

  // üëâ Note that IDBSideSync does NOT support object stores with the autoIncrement option. This
  //  is because if IndexedDB were allowed to auto-assign the "keys" for objects, there would be
  // no guarantee of uniqueness.
  const todosStore = db.createObjectStore('todos', { keyPath: 'id' });

  // Give IDBSideSync a chance to create its own object stores and indices.
  IDBSideSync.onupgradeneeded(event);
};

openreq.onsuccess = () => {
  // Now that the object stores exist, allow IDBSideSync to initiailize itself before using it.
  IDBSideSync.init(openreq.result);
}
```

Now just make sure to use an "IDBSideSync wrapped" version of the IndexedDB object store so that data mutations can be intercepted and recorded in the background as you perform CRUD operations on your data:

```javascript
// Make sure to include IDBSideSync's OPLOG_STORE in the transaction (otherwise it won't be able
// to commit/rollback its own operation log changes as part of the same transaction).
const txRequest = db.transaction(['todos', IDBSideSync.OPLOG_STORE], 'readwrite');
const todoStore = IDBSideSync.proxyStore(txRequest.objectStore('todos'));

// You need to ensure that object keys are unqiue. One option is to use  IDBSideSync's `uuid()`
// convenience function.
const todoId = IDBSideSync.uuid(); // 123
todoStore.add({ id: todoId, title: "Buy milk" }); // { id: 123, title: "Buy milk" }
```

IDBSideSync modifies `put()` so that it only updates the specific properties that you pass in instead of completely replacing objects (i.e., it now supports "partial" updates). This is out of necessity and can't be changed, (but you can always pass in a complete copy of an object to update all of its properties in the store).

```javascript
todoStore.put({ title: "Buy cookies" }, todoId);
todoStore.put({ priority: "high" }, todoId); 

// In a separate transaction...
todoStore.get(todoId).onsuccess = (event) => {
  console.log(event.target.result); // { id: 123, title: "Buy cookies", priority: "high" }
}
```

IDBSideSync modifies `delete()` so that it only "soft deletes" objects (i.e., sets a "deleted" prop on them), and also modifies `get()`, `getAll()` and cursors to filter out the "deleted" objects:

```javascript
todoStore.delete(todoId);

// In a separate transaction...
todoStore.get(todoId).onsuccess = (event) => {
  console.log(event.target.result); // undefined
}
```

## What types of object stores does it work with?

`IDBSideSync` does not support object stores that use `autoIncrement`. If IndexedDB is auto-assigning the object IDs, then it's possible for two separate clients to create an object with the same key/ID. In that scenario, there's no safe way to share and apply oplog entries (i.e., CRDT messages) since they might describe mutations that _appear_ to be relevant to the same object but actually could refer to different objects that have the same key/ID.

Also, `IDBSideSync` currently doesn't support `add(value, key)` or `put(value, key)` calls when `key` is of type `ArrayBuffer` or `DataView`.

## FAQ

### Q: What happens if the same oplog/change message is "ingested" more than once?

It will have no effect on the data store. Message values are only applied to the data store if the message's HLC time is more recent than the current value.

However, it would "corrupt" the Merkle tree (if the tree weren't set up to prevent it) since the hash values would still change when the message's hash is inserted a second time.

### Q: Does it work with Jake Archibald's [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb) library?

Yes. You can pass a sidesync'ed object store to idb's `wrap()` function. Since `IDBSideSync` works as an invisible Proxy, idb won't know the difference.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Test CRUD on store with keyPath that is an array.
    - Modify todo example app so that todo_types store has keyPath: ["id", "name"] (since the name can't be edited).
- [ ] Set up Cypress to run unit tests
    - this will make it possible to run automated tests that are using the real IndexedDB API
- [ ] Modify Rollup to bundle murmurhash and uuid _with_ the library
    - see "https://www.mixmax.com/engineering/rollup-externals/" section of https://www.mixmax.com/engineering/rollup-externals/ for example of which rollup plugins to install and use
    - see https://tsdx.io/customization#example-adding-postcss for example of how to customize tsdx's rollup config to use rollup plugins
- [ ] Incorporate Jared Forsyth's HLC string formatting improvements that allow for longer timestamp and counter strings:
    - `physTime.toString().padStart(15, '0')` // 13 digits is enough for the next 100 years, so 15 is plenty
    - `count.toString(36).padStart(5, '0') // 5 digits base 36 is enough for more than 6 million "out of order" changes
    - https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/hybrid-logical-clocks/
- [ ] Add full integration test/simulation of messages from multiple nodes being processed
    - verify that event ordering is correct (i.e., that various table/row/column values end up with values specified by "most recent" corresponding operation)
    - this will require implementation of in-memory data store
    - how will this work without the use of the merkle tree for efficient diffing? is that even necessary?
    - make sure to prevent the "many changes in same ~10sec window causes issue" problem (https://twitter.com/jaredforsyth/status/1228366315569565696)
- [ ] Set up the project to work with [CodeSandbox CI](https://codesandbox.io/docs/ci).
- [ ] Set up a simple sandbox app in a sub-directory that can be use to demo/test the library (from relative imports)

## Refactoring

- [ ] Consider increasing the allowed difference for clock times coming from other systems; only allowing for a 1-minute difference between any other clock in the distributed system seems like it could be error prone...
- [ ] Modify HLTime.parse() to do a better job of checking for issues with the passed-in string and throwing errors if necessary (e.g., throwing if an invalid month is specified)
- [ ] Merkle tree:
    - [ ] consider only allowing inserts to proceed for "full" 17-digit paths. This would prevent the possibility of setting hash value for non-leaf nodes (which would result in a node whose hash is, technically, not derived from the hashes of all its children). The downside of this is that it would make unit testing harder to easily understand (since you can't use "simple" testing trees with only a few nodes).

## New features

- [ ] Support custom _local_ data store APIs (i.e., support offline, PWA-friendly storage)
    - Currently the "data store" is just a few arrays kept in memory (`_messages` and  `_data`)
    - It should be possible to use other, more efficient data storage mechanisms (e.g., IndexedDB).
    - Instead of accessing `_messages` and `_data` directly as arrays, the data store should be passed-in and manipulated through standard API functions for CRUD operations; the actual implementation for those operations should be a black-box.
    - Example:
        - `sync.js:mapIncomingToLocalMessagesForField()` needs to find the "most recent" message for specific fields. Currently it does this by sorting the big array of `_messages` and searching for the first element with a matching set of field identifier criteria, which clearly becomes less efficient as the array of `_messages` grows over time.
        - Ideally, the data store API would have a `findMostRecentMessageForField()` method that, under the hood, would use pre-built indices for searching messages.
    - `sidesync-store-indexeddb`
    - `sidesync-store-inmemory`

- [ ] Support _syncing_ with remote file storage services
    - Once a standard API exists for the _local_ data store (which can be implemented with different adapters), modify the sync code so that it uses a standard API, which would allow for different remote storage providers to be plugged in.
    - `sidesync-gdrive`, `sidesync-icloud`, etc.
    - each node (e.g., user-owned device) uploads every oplog entry to the server
    - each entry has a filename: the timestamp.toString() value
        - since every timestamp is unique, there shouldn't be any filename collisions
    - each node uploads (and updates) a JSONified version of their merkle tree
        - these merkle tree files should all have a standard extension to be easily discovered by via filename pattern searching (e.g., {nodeId}.merkle.json)
        - with GDrive API, you'd use a query like `name contains '.merkle.json.7z'`
    - a node can download the merkle trees from other nodes and diff _locally_ to more efficiently determine a _time_ at which the merkle trees began to differ
        - it can then download and ingest all oplog entries on/after that time
    - each node updates and uploads an "index" file: an _ordered_ list of all the HLC timestamps (i.e., filenames) for events _that node_ has created
        - these files should all have a standard extension to be easily discovered by via filename pattern searching (e.g., {nodeId}.index.txt)
        - this file should be uploaded to the server on each sync (overwriting the existing file if one exists)
        - other nodes can download this (pre-sorted) list and, after having compared merkle trees with this node to find a timestamp when they began to differ, iterate over (ordered) list of timestamps until it gets to the point where the divergence began--all filenames after that point in the list should be downloaded and processed.
        - these files could get BIG; adding 1M timestamps resulted in a 45MB text file
        - compression could help; this could be diferred to server and browser (assuming server compression is enabled), or _maybe_ done in the browser (JSZip compressed 45MB realistic text file to 134 KB in 1.2 sec)
        - another option that adds complexity is to chunk the indices, maybe putting timestamp ranges in index filenames to help decide which index to download (e.g., `{nodeId}.{firstTimeStamp__lastTimeStamp}.index.txt`)

    - Google Drive doesn't support searching/filtering by regex expressions, so it's probably necessary to:
        1. retrieve a list of _all_ filenames (and just the names--so we know what to try to download)
        2. parse/order that list and start downloading each file with filename after the diff time, OR
        2. OR just iterate over the full list (without sorting) and download each file as necessary
            - if there are thousands of files, this would more efficient since it's not necessary to load the entire list into memory (similar to using a DB cursor)
        - this could be done by "searching" for files using a filename pattern that will exclude oplog entries before some time (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/11011934/62694)
        - OR (maybe simpler but much less efficient), download all file _names_ (i.e., list dir), iterate over them (parsing each filename to an actual HLC time that can be compared to the reference HLC time), and download each one that occurs on/after the reference time.
